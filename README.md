🚀 Software Engineering Portfolio – Lesego Ntsoane


Overview
This repository showcases a collection of production-oriented software projects demonstrating strong foundations in backend engineering, machine learning, real-time systems, and cloud-integrated applications.
The projects emphasize clean architecture, scalability, API design, real-time data processing, and applied AI/ML—skills expected of a modern backend or full-stack engineer.
Each project is built with industry-standard tools, follows best practices, and reflects real-world problem solving rather than academic prototypes.
